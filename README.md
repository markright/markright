# Markright

A new plain text formatting syntax

## Why a new syntax?

We all know **Markdown**: it's great and used everywhere (even this document is written with it).

But it has some flaws:

* Its specs weren't unambiguous by the beginning.
* Many typographical HTML5 tags are not supported by default.
* Some choices make unintuitive to add support for missing tags.

These are exactly the issues that **Markright** aims to solve!

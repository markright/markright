# Markright

A new plain text formatting syntax

## Why a new syntax?

We all know **Markdown**: it's great and it's used everywhere (even this document is written with it).

But it has some flaws:

* Its specs weren't unambiguously by the beginning.
* Many typographical HTML5 tags are not supported by default.
* Some conventions make unintuitive to add support for missing tags.

These are exactly the issues that **Markright** aims to solve!
